  </div>

  </div>

  <div class="page">
    <h2>Aim of the Project</h2>
    <p>To recreate a happier version of the ending of Little Red Riding Hood and understand how creative storytelling can influence morals and feelings.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="page">
    <h2>Materials Used</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Storybook</li>
      <li>Notebook and pen</li>
      <li>Color pencils and markers</li>
      <li>Printed pictures and glue</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="page">
    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <p>I read the original story, imagined a happier version, wrote a new ending, created illustrations, and compiled all elements into a creative project.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="page">
    <h2>Original Ending Summary</h2>
    <p>The wolf eats Grandma and tries to eat Red Riding Hood. A woodcutter arrives and rescues them. The wolf is punished, ending the story with fear and danger.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="page">
    <h2>My Happier Ending</h2>
    <p>Red offers the wolf cookies instead of running away. The wolf, touched by her kindness, promises to be good. They all have tea together and become friends.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="page">
    <h2>Observation and Analysis</h2>
    <p>Changing the ending made the story more uplifting. It encourages children to believe in second chances, peace, and communication.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="page">
    <h2>Inference</h2>
    <p>This project helped me understand how a storyteller can shape emotions through plot choices. Stories are powerful and can inspire positive values.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="page">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Creative writing is not just fun, but it’s also powerful. I learned to imagine, write, draw, and express my ideas through this project.</p>
