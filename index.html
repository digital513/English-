<div class="page"><h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>This project presents a psychological interpretation of the classic tale “Red Riding Hood.” The story delves into themes of trauma, fear, resilience, and self-realization using creative symbolism and character transformation. Each section reflects emotional depth and literary exploration.</p></div>

<div class="page"><h1>Index Page</h1>
<p>The index includes the page numbers for each topic mentioned in the Contents Page. This will help the reader navigate through the project easily.</p></div>

<div class="page"><h1>Aim of the Project</h1>
<p>To explore and reinterpret the fairy tale "Little Red Riding Hood" through a psychological lens, presenting the internal struggles and emotional journey of the protagonist, and promoting critical thinking, imagination, and creative writing.</p></div>

<div class="page"><h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The classic tale of "Little Red Riding Hood" is often told with moral warnings. But what if the story symbolized deeper emotional battles? This project aims to present Red not just as a girl in danger, but as a figure of transformation, strength, and understanding.</p></div>

<div class="page"><h1>Materials Used</h1>
<ul><li>Sketch pens and colored pencils</li>
<li>White A4 sheets</li>
<li>Glue, scissors, stickers</li>
<li>Hand-drawn illustrations</li>
<li>Printed images</li>
<li>Decorative chart borders</li>
<li>Computer for text formatting and layout</li></ul></div>

<div class="page"><h1>Extended Storyline</h1>
<p>Red wasn’t just a girl in a red hood. She lived in a town filled with fear and whispers. Her hood was a symbol of protection from past trauma. The forest wasn’t a place of danger—it was a place of testing. The wolf represented every fear, insecurity, and pain she hid. But unlike the tale, Red didn’t wait for a savior. She stood face to face with the wolf, acknowledged her pain, and found healing by befriending the creature inside. She emerged, not just alive—but reborn.</p></div>

<div class="page"><h1>Visual Story Scenes</h1>
<p>Scene 1: Red walking alone through a misty forest, hood clutched tight.<br>
Scene 2: A shadowy wolf-shaped figure approaching silently.<br>
Scene 3: Red facing her fear, holding a mirror up to the wolf.<br>
Scene 4: The wolf softens, and transforms into light.<br>
Scene 5: Red removes her hood and walks into the sunlight.</p>

<div class="page"><h1>Symbolism Analysis</h1>
<p>The red hood represents protection and hidden trauma. The forest is a symbol of life’s challenges. The wolf stands for internal fear. The mirror reflects self-confrontation. The sunlight at the end symbolizes healing and hope.</p></div>

<div class="page"><h1>Psychological Interpretation</h1>
<p>This version interprets Red as a girl overcoming PTSD. Her journey through the forest mirrors her mental and emotional recovery. Facing the wolf represents accepting and understanding her inner demons rather than fighting them.</p></div>

<div class="page"><h1>Character Study: Red</h1>
<p>Red is brave, sensitive, and determined. She’s not a victim but a survivor. Her transformation shows growth, emotional awareness, and mental strength as she evolves from fearful to fearless.</p></div>

<div class="page"><h1>Character Study: The Wolf</h1>
<p>The wolf is not just a threat but a manifestation of Red’s fear and pain. When confronted, it transforms into a guiding force, helping Red to see her own strength and move beyond trauma.</p></div>

<div class="page"><h1>Literary Tools Used</h1>
<ul><li>Symbolism: Red hood, forest, wolf</li>
<li>Imagery: Misty forest, glowing light</li>
<li>Allegory: Psychological journey through fairy tale</li>
<li>Foreshadowing: Hints about Red’s inner strength</li>
<li>Metaphor: Wolf = fear</li></ul></div>

<div class="page"><h1>Observation and Reflection</h1>
<p>Through this reinterpretation, I learned that stories can be powerful tools for self-expression and healing. It made me reflect on how fears can be faced with understanding rather than fear.</p></div>

<div class="page"><h1>Inferences and Learning</h1>
<p>I inferred that even a simple fairy tale has deep meaning when we look closely. I also learned about emotional strength, creativity, and the importance of facing one's fears instead of running away.</p></div>

<div class="page"><h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>The Red Hooded Girl’s journey shows that bravery is not about fighting monsters but understanding them. The story teaches us that healing is possible and transformation begins with self-acceptance.</p></div>

<div class="page"><h1>Fun Page</h1>
<ul><li>Draw your version of Red and the Wolf</li>
<li>Write a one-line moral of the story</li>
<li>Color a forest background using sketch pens</li></ul></div>
