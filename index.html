    <h2>Page 2: Introduction</h2>
    <p>This project gives a new, happy ending to the classic story of Little Red Riding Hood. Instead of ending in fear, it ends with friendship, kindness, and lessons on how people can change for the better. Through colorful narration and visuals, it inspires children to believe in second chances.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Page 3: Original Story Overview</h2>
    <p>The original story of Little Red Riding Hood is about a girl who travels through the forest to deliver food to her grandmother. On the way, she meets a cunning wolf who tricks her and eats her grandmother. In some versions, Red is also eaten, and in others, a woodcutter saves them both.</p>

    <h2>Page 4: Why Reimagine the Ending?</h2>
    <p>The original ending of the story can be frightening for young readers. By changing the ending to something happier and more positive, children learn that mistakes can be fixed and that even bad characters can learn to do better.</p>

    <h2>Page 5: New Story – The Beginning</h2>
    <p>Red was walking through the forest happily, humming a song. She was taking cookies and juice to her grandmother. On the way, she met the same wolf. But this time, something was different. The wolf looked sad and tired, not scary.</p>

    <h2>Page 6: The Wolf’s Change</h2>
    <p>When Red met the wolf, he didn't try to eat her. Instead, he asked, “Why are you always so kind?” Red smiled and said, “Because the world becomes better with kindness.” The wolf paused. For the first time, someone was kind to him.</p>

    <h2>Page 7: Red’s Grandmother</h2>
    <p>Red and the wolf reached her grandmother's house. Grandmother was surprised to see the wolf but didn't panic. She served tea and listened to the wolf’s story. He told them that he had no friends and was lonely. Grandmother hugged him warmly.</p>

    <h2>Page 8: A New Friendship</h2>
    <p>From that day, the wolf promised to be good. He helped Red collect flowers, fix grandma's fence, and even plant vegetables. The villagers, at first afraid, saw the change and began inviting him to festivals. Red and the wolf became best friends.</p>
